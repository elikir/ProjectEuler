# ProjectEuler
A portfolio of some of my project euler problems done in python


=========
I completed 1-4 before I took my fundamentals of computer science course at Northeastern, and there will be a big shift in how my code looks after that.  I will follow something called the design recipe to help ensure I program the way I think about it.

1. Signature - this will be what the function consumes and what it outputs
2. Checks - these will be checks to use to ensure the function outputs what is expected with an input
3. Writing the code
